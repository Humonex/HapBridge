The NG50 : Whatshap stats
Phased Block N50ï¼šTo eliminate the impact of switch errors on phasing accuracy, we introduced the Phased Block N50,
by splitting blocks at switch error positions. This metric aims to offer a more realistic assessment of the
effective phase block length.
Usage:
python extract_switch_error.py -iswitch_error switch_error.tsv -ivcf phased.vcf -ivcf_truth truth.vcf -ovcf phased_no_swtich_error.vcf
-iswitch_error --The input Switch_error file Whatshap compare
-ivcf --The input VCF file, phased by Whatshap, Hapcut2, HapBridge.
-ivcf_truth --The benchmark file
-ovcf --The output vcf file.
